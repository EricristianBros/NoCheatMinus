# Description:  Unfortunately, it isn't possible to determine which packets are sent by/to the player. There are some workarounds to track behaviors, which are untypical in certain movement/network states. Due to network latency issues, those workarounds aren't suitable for evaluating whether the player is using client modifications or not.  For this reason, UnfittingPacket violations won't increase the global violation level (= there won't be a punishment for failing this check). Nevertheless, all workarounds for packet/network tracking can be found here.
# Fail:         This check fails if the player sents a unfitting packet in a certain movement/network state.
# Subchecks:    - PlayerMoveC2SPacket whilst OffGround
#               - PlayerRespawnS2CPacket whilst Alive
